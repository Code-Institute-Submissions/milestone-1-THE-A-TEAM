## Surface
The “petrol blue” and “dark maroon” colours were chosen from the Home page hero-image key characters and used 
throughout the site to create a consistent feel, but always having an eye on contrast so elements are easy to read.

Decided on the Googlefont “Play” as when made italic it blends very nicely to the logo. Also at the same time I 
found the use of italic and normal gives the impression of using two fonts without having to download a second.

## Technologies Used
- HTML and CSS programming languages.
- Bootstrap v4.4.1 - used to help with grid layout and responsive design.
- jQuery - responsive Bootstrap navbar, fill in form value on file selection.
- FontAwesome - for the site icons.
- GitPod - online IDE used to create this project.
- Google Fonts - for the website font 'Play'.
- Youtube - hosts the news video.

## Features
All the site pages have a responsive navigation bar with team logo on the top-left.
At the bottom of all site pages is the footer which gives the main address information and the social media links.

[Home](https://devtoguk.github.io/milestone-1-THE-A-TEAM/index.html) 

The Home page has an hero-image to create impact when you first arrive on the site.
Within the hero image is a call to action statement to prompt a potential client to get in touch.
After the hero-image are two sections, the first to inform potential clients how The A-Team can help and the second to give some testimonials.
