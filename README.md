## Surface
The “petrol blue” and “dark maroon” colours were chosen from the Home page hero-image key characters and used 
throughout the site to create a consistent feel, but always having an eye on contrast so elements are easy to read.

Decided on the Googlefont “Play” as when made italic it blends very nicely to the logo. Also at the same time I 
found the use of italic and normal gives the impression of using two fonts without having to download a second.

## Technologies Used
- HTML and CSS programming languages.
- Bootstrap v4.4.1 - used to help with grid layout and responsive design.
- jQuery - responsive Bootstrap navbar, fill in form value on file selection.
- FontAwesome - for the site icons.
- GitPod - online IDE used to create this project.
- Google Fonts - for the website font 'Play'.
- Youtube - hosts the news video.

## Acknowledgments

Inspiration for this project came from:
Remembering the 80’s TV show The A-Team, about a band of mercenaries, whom, if you could find them, then you could 
hire them to solve your problem. Taking that core idea and merging it with Marvels Avengers.
