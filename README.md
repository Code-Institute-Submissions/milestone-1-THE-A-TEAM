## Surface
The "petrol blue" and "dark maroon" colours were chosen from the Home page "hero-image" key characters and used 
throughout the site to create a consistent feel, but always having an eye on contrast so elements are easy to read.

Chose the Googlefont “Play” as when made italic it blends very nicely to the logo. Also at the same time I 
found the use of italic and normal gives the impression of using two fonts without having to download a second.

## Technologies Used

[Home](https://devtoguk.github.io/milestone-1-THE-A-TEAM/index.html) 

The Home page has an hero-image to create impact when you first arrive on the site.
Within the hero image is a call to action statement to prompt a potential client to get in touch.
After the hero-image are two sections, the first to inform potential clients how The A-Team can help including a button to link to
the contact us page and the second to give some clients testimonials.

On desktops and tablets the 'We can help' section displays in three seperate columns, while on smaller screens and mobiles 
it then displays in one continuous column. 

The testimonials section displays in two columns with images on desktop and tablets, on smaller screens they display in one
column with images, and finally on mobiles the testimonial images are not shown.

## Acknowledgments

Inspiration for this project came from:
Remembering the 80’s TV show **[The A-Team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_A-Team)**, about a band of mercenaries, 
whom, if you could find them, then you could hire them to solve your problem. Taking that core idea and merging it 
with some of the characters from **[Marvel's Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film))**. 
A big thank you to my mentor, the Slack communnity and many great reference sites out there including Stackoverflow and W3Schools.
